Database and Binary Storage Interface with adapter(s), written in Scala

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SeanCheatham/scala-storage-wrappers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SeanCheatham/scala-storage-wrappers)

# Overview
This library serves two purposes:
1. Provide a common abstraction for accessing and manipulating databases and binary storage backends
2. Provide adapters for various databases and storage backends

I am a one-man show, so at best, what you see here is work I need in side projects.  I've open-sourced this library because other people may find some of it useful.

# Usage
This library is written in Scala.  It _might_ interoperate with other JVM languages, but I make no guarantees.

## Include the library in your project.
